# Xfinity does not support DOCSIS 2.0 modems

Saturday and Sunday, June 23-24, 2018

## Steps

1. Purchased an old modem (1) at Goodwill (2) for $4.99.
2. Connected coaxial cable and ethernet to computer.
3. Followed in-browser prompts by Xfinity to activate service.
4. Once activated, the modem is not able to transfer operational parameters through TFTP (3).
5. Contacted Xfinity for explanation. The representative explained that the modem is [DOCSIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS) 2.0. Xfinity supports DOCSIS 3.0 but does not support DOCSIS 2.0.
